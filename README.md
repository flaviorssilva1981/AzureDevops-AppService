ðŸš€ End-to-End CI/CD on Azure with GitHub, Azure DevOps & App Service

![Azure DevOps App Service Architecture](azure_devops_app_services.PNG)


I recently worked on an Azure cloud architecture that automates deployments and provides full observability across environments.

ðŸ”¹ Source Control: GitHub as the repository for collaboration and versioning
ðŸ”¹ CI/CD: Azure DevOps Pipelines for build, test, packaging, and automated deployments
ðŸ”¹ Application Hosting:

Azure App Service (DEV & STAGE) â€“ fully managed web hosting platform that handles scaling, security patches, and availability

Simplified deployments with deployment slots for staging and blue/green testing

Integrated scaling rules and custom domains for production-grade readiness
ðŸ”¹ Observability: Application Insights for deep application performance monitoring (APM), Azure Monitor for metrics/alerts, and Log Analytics for centralized query and analysis
ðŸ”¹ Analytics: Azure Analytics dashboards help transform operational data into insights for both technical and business stakeholders

âœ¨ The power of Azure App Service is that it abstracts infrastructure complexityâ€”developers push code, and Azure takes care of the rest (runtime, OS, patches, scaling). Combined with DevOps pipelines and observability tools, it provides a complete, reliable, and agile application lifecycle.

ðŸ’¡ This architecture accelerates delivery while ensuring applications are monitored, scalable, and always available.
